# emu-fight

Consider you want the output of expensive simulations that you can not easily repeat (maybe it is too slow or complex). An emulator approximates these outputs given the inputs you would give to the simulation. 
In order to produce this approximation, the emulator must be trained on previously run pairs of inputs-outputs.

This project comprised of a pedagogical tool to compare different emulation methods; may the best emu win!
