Consider you want the output of expensive simulations that you can not easily repeat (maybe it is too slow or complex). An emulator approximates these outputs given the inputs you would give to the simulation. 
In order to produce this approximation, the emulator must be trained on previously run pairs of inputs-outputs. Emulators have found widespread use in astronomy. See the papers below for some examples from different areas!

This project comprised of a pedagogical tool to compare different emulation methods; may the best emu win!

Papers using emulators: 
"Emulation of reionization simulations for Bayesian inference of astrophysics parameters using neural networks" by Schmit and Pritchard
"Incorporating astrochemistry into molecular line modelling via emulation" by de Mijolla et al. 
"Bayesian emulator optimisation for cosmology: application to the Lyman-alpha forest" by Rogers et al. 
"ECoPANN: A Framework for Estimating Cosmological Parameters Using Artificial Neural Networks" by Wang et al.
"Cosmological parameter estimation via iterative emulation of likelihoods" by Ibanez et al.
