A common problem in cosmology is inferring the cosmological parameters that govern our universe - such as the overall density of matter and baryons. We can do this by running giant simulations of fake universes where we know the input cosmological parameters. We can then measure galaxy clustering statistics (e.g. a power spectrum) on both the real and fake universes, and compare them. However, we have the same problem here as we did with the emu speed simulator: it's very slow so we can't run a simulation and get statistics at all possible parameter sets."
